## SVG To Xaml

### Requirements
 - Visual Studio 2022

### Xaml To Xpath
* When the toggle switch is set to the right: The application parses the XAML and converts it into a ResourceDictionary. This ResourceDictionary can then be used to reference and apply the XAML-defined resources, such as icons or shapes, throughout the application.
